# study-html-css
This is a project-based course I followed to learn and apply HTML 5 and CSS 3 to create a YouTube clone! 

I have not finished this project (turns out recreating duplicates of pre-existing websites is really boring) but
I have learned a lot from this project. To begin, the project is to create a one-for-one copy of the YouTube home
page where there are many options for users to explore with many kinds of buttons and menus. 

I learned everything from hovering transitions to the nested flexbox technique! As fun as it was to learn these
things, I hope to move on to more creative projects. This was definitely a great place to start... I hope I can
learn more with the frameworks I have scheduled for myself to learn.
